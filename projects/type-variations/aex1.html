      <h1>If you forget me</h1>
      <h3>a poem by Pablo neruda and comments by elizabeth Troval</h3>
    </section>
 <section class="projects">
  <p>“In “If you forget me,” Neruda emphasizes the need for reciprocity in his romance, though the subject of the poem isn’t completely clear. Some analysts say the poet is speaking of his home country Chile – as the poem was written during Neruda’s exile at the time of Pinochet’s coup – though he could easily be referencing his lover and third wife, Matilde Urrutia. Capturing the emotional intensity of love along with its insecurities, perhaps Neruda is commenting on both. His roots in Chile and his relationship with Urrutia impacted him greatly and had a profound affect on his identity. One thing is for sure, Neruda’s words will never be forgotten.”</p>

      <section class="article">

<P>I want you to know <br>
  one thing.<br>
You know how this is:<br>
if I look<br>
at the crystal moon, at the red branch<br>
of the slow autumn at my <br>
window,<br>
if I touch<br>
near the fire<br>
the impalpable ash<br>
or the wrinkled body of the log,<br>
everything carries me to you,<br>
as if everything that exists,<br>
aromas, light, metals,<br>
were little boats<br>
that sail<br>
toward those isles of yours that wait for me.<br>
Well, now,<br>
if little by little you stop loving me<br>
I shall stop loving you little by little.<br>
If suddenly<br>
you forget me<br>
do not look for me,<br>
for I shall already have forgotten you.<br></P>
