      <h1>Excerpt from The Emergent Self</h1>
      <h3>Francisco Varela</h3>
    </section>
  <p class="pull-quote">“These ideas help us to come to a real appreciation of what it means to have an identity &mdash; to comprehend what we think of as our own mind.”</p>
  <p class="vert-quote">My mind has the quality of “being here” so I can relate to others. Foe example, I interact; but when I try to grasp it, it's nowhere &mdash; it's distributed in the underlying network.</p>
      <section class="article">
        <P>I see the mind as an emergent property, and the very important and interesting consequence of this emergent property is our own sense of self. My sense of self exists because it gives me an interface with the world. I'm “me” for interactions, but my “I” doesn't substantially exist, in the sense that it can't be localized anywhere.</P>

<P>This view, of course, resonates with the notions of the other biological sense I mentioned, but there are subtle and important differences. An emergent property, which is produced by an underlying network, is a coherent condition that allows the system in which it exists to interface at that level &mdash; that is, with other selves of identities of the same kind.</P>

<p>You can never say, “This property is here; it's in this component.” In the case of autopoiesis, you can't say that life &mdash; the condition of being self-produced &mdash; is in this molecule, or in the DNA, or in the cellular membrane, or in the protein. Life is in the configuration and in the dynamical pattern, which is what embodies it as an emergent property</p>
<p>I find it fascinating to apply this same line of analysis to my own mind, in the cognitive domain. My own sense of self, “me,” can be seen in the same light. I have to be relentless to hold on to my identity. These ideas help us to come to a real appreciation of what it means to have an identity &mdash; to comprehend what we think of as our own mind.</p>
